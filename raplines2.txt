Off the top freestyle to Lyrical Logic Instrumental by Da Enfatry
my hearts in a trillion shards
pick'd as my paints peel'n apart
spills tears of ink that bleed an seep through
slingshot my feelings so far, I can't reach you
stings a lot life is more than a B(ee)
just like a queen she screws (up) everything
it feels so post mortem an heavy
like a ghost who wore black to a wedding
I'm sealed by a curse it's five minus eight
an unlucky fate that the stars had made
the moon sign turned against my house
ma come back it burns an drowns
mama please don't leave me
I know you see me
my tears there bleeding
how can you be so 'vegetable'
when I was what you were seeding
wrap'd feel'n's up like a burrito
grieve'n, trapped need'n placebo
left me dead before arrival
no com'n back or welcome home revival
ventilators, surgeries, will it even matter
expenses waiver, hurt'n, feel like brain splatter
why you so cold ma, you weren't dead
try to console, breathe, can you hear what I've said
I said I love you, can you hear me now
horizon not verizon,I'm fearing these sounds
that echo down the longest hallway
feels like hell is one call away
I can hear demons screaming my name
but it was you, your voice had changed
mama please don't leave me
I know you see me
my tears there bleeding
how can you be so 'vegetable'
when I was what you were seeding
what will I do with myself now
all I ever did was love you
you couldn't do it back
I understand that was a virtue
I forgive you an I am sorry
I could never understand
that you didn't know how
cuz you were never dealt a hand
wasted so much energy being angry
didn't bother with you over time
now it hits me harder with every single chime
acceptance is a paradox
like a pair of socks
one can get lost
thrown in an bleach'd in the wrong wash
shrink you up, cut you down to size
ma I wish we could have been friends in this life
the distance is further than the speed of light
tunnel vision, no sleep
someone turn out my mind, she is not all right
Zepplin I'm steppin to heaven
Sippin from 7/11
Wait, lemme stop mimicking flows I know that I be better than ever
You know that I'm feelin the vibe
Just another nigga tryna get by
I been on a roll I'm living the life
Butter up to me you fitna get sliced, woah
Know that peter piping pickin peppers but you know that Roane is hot as jalapenos
I been up here in the kitchen whippin in the skillet fitna make a filet mignon
Niggas think they ready but when they approach I burn em with the pen in every stroke
And I'm turning heroes into villains, on my Machiavelli when this nigga get in control
DAMN
Hook:
Man, why you kill my vibe
Like have you seen my mood was on a natual high
Like why you kill my vibe I swear you born a sad sadist
I revive the loud, and now I'm way back high like I am
Verse 2:
You know I lean with it, rock with it
I'm so clean and I'm pocketting
All this green like I'm robbin it

Know all these people try stoppin it
Catch de-feet like my mocassins woah

Verse 3:
Lemme get a minute with any woman, Dominican
Im fitna get a lickin with any mention of Benjamin

Fam you so ill, lemme give you some medicine
I hit the plug, with a slug, got a shot, for my mug, but my mother still loving the sentiment
Ugh
Im go spaz and then pass
Honing my craft to max
Ay go and laugh at the tracks
Ay get my racks from the back
Count it

Imma go walk with a thot
Park in a handicap spot
I dont really care whatchu thought
Still grab Jenny from the block
Hook: Man, why you kill my vibe

verse 1
i'm no rebel but i'm surely no conformist
communist? hell no. i'm just a fucking absurdist
i make sense outta nonsense, see the real in unreal
feel pain cherish joy,and still doubt what i really feel
i don't think, i just flow with my stream of consiousness
prefer phsychosis cuz reality is really a mess
You must be wondering why the hell i am telling you this
i don't know amigo, i'm a fucking absurdist.
chorus
Absurdist, well that's who i am
live and rule my own world where i'm the champ
and if you got a problem
i'll fucking kick you in the nuts
so screw you guys, i'm going home.
Verse 2
i'm not delusional just overly optimistic
so i am the misfit among them pessimistic
lowlifes, always so cynical hypercritical
'bout life cuz their own is so bloody miserable.now aint that right?
fuck that though, i got big dreams and ambitions
of being rich and famous, and getting tons of recognition
and that's my only mission the one that i envision
day and night, and if that makes me wierd, i guess its all right
chorus
Absurdist, well that's who i am
live and rule my own world where i'm the champ
and if you got a problem
i'll fucking kick you in the nuts
so screw you guys, i'm going home.
spazzing with the pen rapping crisp again
I’m dabbing with the trends, oughta spit amends

Grabbing in a spellbound, now I’m hell bound what I’m supposed
To dial down my rounds. No. Roger Federer isn’t stopping instead he’s got a
Gallinger cocked to your neck he’s ready to drop the lead in here and drop a
Heavy shark. At you doorstep he gets the huge croc, blue head with casket knocks a
Bell ta start. The blue force crept behind. He spewed shot. To death with words. Yes off-cer
He lyrically murdered and put him in bars. Raps a fuckin company, he’s in charge

Catch me in the kitching cooking killer riddles like im dilla on the mic
I'm eating up these motherfuckers like godzilla in his prime

Intro#3Rich-Chris
it’s been a long time since you left shit will never change
you’ll be the most best rapper of all time
Goodbye forever even thought you’ll be here wit us.
Tupac was a legend we won’t forget the day you died brother
goodbye you’ll always be the shit
Verse M8rix
We Need Tupac In chalk don't mock this legend
Reverend Gunned down by a clown
This caused a breakdown Downtown of the rapper community
Friday Mighty Bloody '96 society Anxiety
Take his life to survive listen to the cries today
Someday you will be found even underground
This is wack why would you attack this man
His Career was clear he has now disappeared
He Built Raps for style you were hostile
Chorus-Rich-chris
Tupac was legend he said Reality is wrong.
Dreams are for real what’s the big deal He died for no reason
he was like a brother to me when he left it felt like a big hole
in all the shit I was goin through Tupac this is for you bro
you should be here on earth wit us but you had to die on some real $hit
Verse ReddPeriidition
You'll always be in my memory
No matter where I go
What I do
Or say
You'll always be in my memory
How could I forget the one person that impacted my life so greatly?
May have said a few hurtful words here and there but you still didn't hate me
We had a close bond
A friendship
An eternal relationship
That never came to and end
But at the end of the feud we'd always come back and make up our amends
To me you were the greatest that ever will be
No one can replace you
Your like a rare collectors edition that you only find once
You were the other half of me
Split half
Shared the same memories
We'd see eye to eye on so many different levels I thought it was crazy
I couldn't believe there was a person just like me
When I had no one else to look to in my time of need,then you were there
You were the one in my corner
Went through the fire
The brimstone
And still came out on top of the ashes just for me
Conquered the big and the small just to come through for me
ChorusoneM8rix
Legend here then he Disappeared
Everything built in skilled Word lines
he Lights shine on his life
Taken too soon like a big Boom
Crank the volume of the costume
VerseDevilsAngel
2pac...you were our leader...
Neither B.I.G or P Diddy aren't better then you either...
Your a memorial... you were equal and lethal.
They should make your life a sequel.
What happened to you shouldn't have...
I'm sorry the Devil got ahold of you in his grasp.
You were model us all, in front of you we'd bow down and crawl.
You were are leader, our saviour...
Ask for help, we give you any favor.
Your hits were major, you were no stranger.
But now your dead, your fate was read.
There were jealous of you, so they had to take care of you.
Not in the good way, but they should've just stayed away.
I hope the murder case was solved and they got arrested for that shit.
Wish you could look at them right now and spit,
On their face, you were in ace, god gave you grace.
You were a warrior to the human race...
It's fucked up what people do.
Just to get what they want from you.
Just cause they can't do it themselves...
They can't even get triple twelves.
You got wings...and you flew...
Now everyone will follow you...
Because everyone knows who you were and we'll always follow you all the way through.
ChorusDevilsAngel
pac...you were our man...
Your the reason rap began...
Now your gone, but this is where you belong.
We'll follow your dream, we'll be a team...
Under you...the one... the true...
Verse Ikonic-of-SME
I didn't listen to this legend
Not born in the right era, I regret
That and the fact that
He seemed to be an inspiring G
Until his life they steal
I know the mic reeled
When that fateful day dawned
At a hateful place falled
An influence to everyone who
Grateful for what he gave the game, mourned
His passing
Though I was never a fan
I know it's tragic
He accomplished so much and managed
To turn something so rough into a hattrick
Never trash, 'cause he had this
Led rap's greatest
Set out and made it
Never fled or gave in
And now he will never be faded...

Different dimensions,
I’m heading through different accenscions,
Telling you, been reminiscing,
Bout the business, for some minutes, film my mistress,
Tell me is you with me, is you really with me,
I was in the field, calling shots,
Spittin icky, why they slippy, slimey,
Rip the money, ain’t it funny
Cause honesty be power,
Find me in the tower,
Low as my lows could me,
Imagine my highs could peak
Peeling the diary,
I am the finest piece,
And life be the puzzle,
And if you don’t get it, know you gon’ get got,
Mercy to my pen, more sin than a bus stop
Tryna put me in the pen, no bend, press stop,
Oh you been, raiding, I passed ya, Dak Prescott
Ha, and
I heard you think you got it,
Funny, cause the same thing was said,
When the devil tossed his options,
I ain’t ever stopping,
All net, green light,
Running through the red light,
You a deer stuck in headlights,
Itching to top my last track,
Like itching on some head lice

So tell me why I deal with your devil side
I deal with your dangerous mind
But never with you
(1st Verse)
I wrote this song for a reason, imma tell you why
We're on the best season, Where everything smiles
Nature smiles and Sunlight, everything turned
into light, shine bright like a dia-, celebratin your birth
And on this day, a princess was born
You're just a pride for your parents so they ain't mourn
and if someday you're gone, life will surely transform
But i never intent to scorn you always keep me warm
You're the sun to my storm, the key to my problems
Hope we meet when we get older, (re)member our promise?
Undescribable! I hope i can, I'm usin' all my conscience
Ain't losin' all my conscience, you're the light to my darkness
Regardless you're heartless, you're a queen, i've never seen
Despite you're dumb you're always mean
You know what you mean!
to me you're the world baby girl
Enjoy this day as you can , i just wish you a SWEET SIXTEEN!
(Hook)
(2nd Verse)
Today is your day, our best way to celebrate
Even a song ain't enough, i would make for you eight
I spent days thinkin' of this date, lookin' for a way to make you levitate
And to you this song i dedicate
to you yes i do, and i don't wanna see you meditate
You been encouragin me to rap, i do appreciate
You push me to the better, to an upper grade
You're actually the reason why my raps are so great
A paragraph ain't enough for ya
you deserve a whole book for ya
in the middle of fake people you been so loyal
by my side when i'm glorious, by my side when i'm down
i been lookin for someone like you thank god i found
you know i'm hurt even with no sound, you heal my wounds
i'm sarcastic but i never intent to offend, i hope you comprehend
as khalid said, i found peace in your violence, in my silence, you understand
Thus you're more than just a friend
(Hook)
It seems to be all I can’t take
No running away, no running away
If I can have a couple of days
What’s left will seem like a haze
You're always on my mind
Cuz you left me in a daze
Left me in a daze
Left me in a daze, for you
Your love, your touch, your feel
Will leave me in a daze
Your mine, tonight, your face
Will leave me in a daze
Look out for me, see that I’m following you
Your, the one, for me
Cuz you’ll leave me in a daze
Leave me in a days, for you
No need for foul play
I know that I can wait
But I always think of you
Because you're so fine
But there's no need, to leave, me here
Stuck in the friend zone,
All alone ,Leave me in a daze
Leave me in a daze
Leave me in a daze, for you
Your love, your touch, your feel
Will leave me in a daze
Your mine, tonight, your face
Will leave me in a daze
Look out , for me, see that I am,
following you
Your, the one, for me
Cuz you’ll leave me in a daze
Leave me in a daze, for you
Dont know, how I got here
Don’t know, what I’m doing here
Don’t know, how you got me here
When I'm alone all I can think of is you
Because you left me in a daze, for you
I’ll leave you in a daze, for me
Left me in a haze, for you
Your love, your touch, your feel
Will leave me in a daze
Your mine, tonight, your face
Will leave me in a daze
Look out, for me, see that I’m following you
Your, the one, for me
Cuz you’ll leave me in a daze
Leave me in a daze, for you
For you, in a haze
For you, in a haze
Leave me in a daze, for you
On the outside standing strong like shit don't faze me
Maybe, because it's eatin' me up on the inside daily
Crazy I just keep findin myself in the same damn boat
Lost a float, message in a bottle, murder he wrote
Soaked, I keep feelin' like I'm losin' all of my friends
This shit keeps going on and no one comprehends
Or understands, people gettin' worked up and upset
Still not up yet, apparently I still haven't had enough yet
Shit goes great for a while then it all falls to pieces
I have a thesis, trends up and down more than Nasdaq
How whack, feelin' like we're havin more fights than fun
I just wanna be done, shit really might not have begun
My boys got my back, nope only one of em thats a fact
My girls got my back, nope none of em now, thats whack
I can't relax, lately I'm on edge, just waitin to burst
When worst comes to worst, apparently it's you first
I feel like shit, I can't sleep, I'm hungry but I can't eat
I thought we could, apparently we just can't compete
Dot Dot delete, retreat, I'll be damned if I do repeat/
I forget now how it was we all even came to meet
We've had good times, and we've had a few fights
But never would I trade it back for all of the nights
That I spent with you, you, her, him and the crew
Parkin' lot pimpin', partyin', kickin it, or whatever we do
We did, what do they say if it's too good to be true
It probably is, but fuck we just tryna have fun like kids
Well, we're growin' up, next year we'll probably all be gone
Thinkin back reminiscing on how this shit all went wrong
Sing a song, dance, drink, smoke some tree, whatever
Rock bottom, shit can only get better, I'll miss forever
Thinkin' I'm just sayin' all this shit just to be sayin' it?
Nah, theres a message here man, and I'm conveyin' it
So I'm telling you this all right now for your own benefit
Read this slow, at least take away a good 95 percent of it
There's a lotta shit goin' on right now, no ones gonna know
Woah, I tried, so now I'm a sit back and watch the show
Take it like a man, take one for the team like my homie
Apparently you didn't know me, as well as I thought
If you can't have it, it's always somethin' you want
True talk, so if I upset you then yeah I do apologize
But realize, those real eyes, see through those real lies.
Do you hate me now?
Are you hating how
Things came about
Or are you happy I'm gone?
Do you think about me?
Do you dream about me?
Do you sing about me?
Or are the memories all gone?
I'm laying here, waiting to just disappear
Realizing my greatest fear, realizing I hate it here
Oh Lord
Depression and obsession
Realizing I never got the message
How could i really question?
Everyday was a blessing
I got too big headed
And I took you for granted
You never could stand it
Now I'm wondering how the fuck you could manage
Now I'm wondering how the fuck we could plan it
Now I'm wondering how the fuck to take it back
But it's too late, I done did the damage

Did it all on purpose
Step into your building to make 'em nervous
Better cuff your bitch cause she lurking
Spilling all these drinks that I purchased
Yeah, something real strange
When I look around I see real things
If you make it out your feelings
'Cause this is how I'm feeling
(Bridge)
This is how I'm feeling (yeah)

This is how I'm feeling

(Verse 1)
That Bou Lou gonna give me a billion
Inshallah run it back lord willing
I'm gonna be off on an island chilling
I came a long way from dope dealing
And I still run with the 5-6 villain
We live life like it ain't no ceilings
Never been a limit tecca nina be killing, ah!
I feel like break-dancing
'Cause I got every bitch in the place straight glancing
While they next to they lover looking at me hate stancing
But I'm always with niggas just like a fake clansman
How I'm feeling is people keep using identical syllables
Switch it up a little bit I'm feeling that off on this planet is the only one feelable
To the masses perhaps to the people not needing variety
Since the umbilical, don't hate the mirror so
I'm just a rapper that happens to kill a bro
When I be clapping to kill it all so pillable, ah
(Chorus)
Did it all on purpose
Step into your building to make you nervous
Better cuff your bitch 'cause she lurking
Spilling all these drinks I purchase
Yeah something real strange
When I look around I see real things
If you make it out your feelings
'Cause this is how I'm feeling
(Bridge)
This is how I'm feeling (yeah)
This is how I'm feeling
This is how I'm feeling
This is how I'm feeling
Money calling i have been balling with no trace
Making money many just hate, so i stay alone in my place
Nightmares in a chase,they wanna erase me from the grace
But am always hitting my target, spitting from my emotions
Ain't fucking with none and i got every reason to spit
I create decisions for myself, above the existence in this shit
Everything keeps changing,but i see no changes for the homeless
They also got countless of blessings, and we keep been heartless
Is it the darkness in our heart, to see them fall apart hopeless
They also need changes, and happiness from been helpless
Things looks strange to me but none ain't a stranger to me
I will rather be a failure, than to shatter my dreams as a rapper
Sitting in the dark i just capture the silence for an answer
Thinking ahead of my future and not the loser they think i am
Love or hate am still the same in the drill with rough times
I fight for my needs and am still fighting to build something good
They never understood me until the income comes out of the wisdom
I came to numb the pain as a victim in the system
It looks insane so i got to explain it with music from been in vain
Fuck the side looks thinking am hook in my living for no good
Y'all just suck a dick living from day one with no luck to stick on
I'm upon those titles and the finals looking for marks in trials
Unh (A 1-2-3 in the house)
Unh, unh, unh (A Young Caffeine in the-)
Unh, unh, unh (A young man Roane in the house)
Unh, unh, unh (A young man Slacks in the-)
I’m the shit, it don’t stink, ‘cause I had some guacamole
Eyes so green, walking over like they know me
High dope-fiends talking slower 'cause they hoping
I ain't noticing they lawn-mowers when they get to cutting
On my grass, on my gas, never mids, but still mad relaxed when it is
Imma have to get to taxing these kids
Surpassing these kids, never asking these kids
For their bullshit opinions, yellow-belly minions
Fuck that shit, like avocados in the billions
Fucking up her feelings, fuck her friend on the ceiling
That's the floor of the third-story, she can hear it now, on the second-story reeling
Picky people pick yourselves up and get the fuck out
That sticky-icky-icky waits for no one in doubt
And at the party ain't nobody come with any clout
Except for Slacks, man, you know I gotta let it route
Take it for a drive, I'm going deeper than a dive
Plenty fish in the sea only wishing on me to arrive
Me to derive, a look of need in their eyes
You don't need to disguise it, come be with the guys with
The feeling so fine it's like magic when I'm rhyming, so dramatic our timing
With two planets alligning in my eye-sight
Goddamnit, girl, your hiney been alligned right
And we call this the groove, and we call this the funk
And your avocado smooth, Imma lick it all up
(Lick it all up, lick-lick it all up)
(Lick it all up, lick-lick it all up)
La-la
Lick it all up, lick-lick it all up
Lick it all up, lick-lick it all up
Lick it all up, lick-lick it all up
Lick it all up
<span class="emph">Roane</span>
(Lick it all up)
Step up in the booth, fire like a Charizard
Been here getting paid, I don't want you all involved
Got avocados living in my brain
Dip the chip into the guac and now I know I got it made
I was sitting in my living room finna watch the Mav's
Out the corner of my eye, a moment that I had to catch
Got the big fat dippers and I put them in my lap
Trynna limit all the salt? Guacamole's where it's at
(Yuh)
My crew green with the envy
Better than anybody that wanna come and get me
I’ve been away but now I’m back and looking for Emmy
Records of my life been on TV and playing daily
Know once the green fades, everything turning black
Watch out for the pit, avocado rap
I got women lining up around the block to love me fast
But really they just wanna use me like an avocado mask
It's fools gold
Take it slow
Get in your role
When ya money start to rot the real color gonna show
Blacker the berry that mean the sweeter the juice
Unless you rocking with avocados, you finna go puke
I made a milli by betting philly, I’m making ya move
Turning down all of my profits, you will appear on the news
I got feeling that there is something I’m missing about you
But all the women I’m feeling say that aint no type of true
I'll give a dollar for every second you gimme a view
Nah wait, I’m just playing with you
You ain’t gonna find me in the backyard
Begging ya that hard
I'll put an avocado in my greeting, I said I’d give you a cash card
I know it ain't the same
49 cents, I put it right by your name
And if you didnt notice how I’m feeling like the POTUS
I don’t need no more support because all my competition choking away
<span class="emph">Slacks</span>
And we call this the groove, and we call this the funk
And your avocado smooth, Imma lick it all up
(Lick it all up, lick-lick it all up)
(Lick it all up, lick-lick it all up)
La-la
Chorus (Sammy B):
I'm the man from the jump
I'm the man from the jump
I'm the man from the jump
I'm the man from the jump
Made it out the struggle
Made it out the jungle
Bitches wanna cuddle
But I could never love em
Verse 1 (Uche):
I'm the man from the jump boy
You the man from the dump boy
This the man that you bump boy
Shooting shots never pump boy
Never pump straight shots
Yeah, Never miss like a bot
Yeah, Real niggas don't talk
Yeah, Ice flow like PAC
Should I wear gucci or bape
Stepping out fresh like I bathed
Scoring on every first date
I'd like to call that an ace
Get a homerun skip the base
Pulling out leaving no trace
Pulling out leaving no trace
I'm bout to feast, say my grace
I'm a star, gimme some space
Me and Sammy give you three lines when you meet us
Have you sold with three lines like adidas
Everything fast pace like the cheetahs
You be getting last place never beat us
Out for blood, more than fucking Dracula
Got you flippin like I'm spongebob with the spatula
I don't need defence if I'm straight attacking ya
Smacking ya, got complete control like I'm hacking ya
All my tings are foreign like a peso
Tossing ya, you can call me a tornado
Made it out the jungle, ain't no piece of cake
Ain't no piece of pie
Ain't no silver plate
No survivor guide
Ain't no second place
Man I'd rather die
If you ain't chasing dreams boy you gotta try
Chorus:
I'm the man from the jump
I'm the man from the jump
I'm the man from the jump
I'm the man from the jump
Made it out the struggle
Made it out the jungle
Bitches wanna cuddle
But I could never love em
Verse 2 (Sammy B):
Made it from the bottom
I'm a fucking problem
I'm so fucking awesome
Like a flower I'ma blossom
Make my competition fall like it's autumn
Got some Jordans on and you know I finna rock em
I'm the man from the jump
Pump fake make em jump
You're irrelevant chump
Bass so hard it thump
Just look at me stunting
Stunting in public
Bitches they love it
Niggas they fronting
Niggas they bluffing
I'm so cunning
Hopped in the game now we run it
What can I say we the shit
Diamonds they flip and they skip
Wrist so wet that it drip and you slip
Coming for your head make you dip
We hop in the whip and we zip
Captain of the ship make you quit
Chain shining bright yeah it's lit
Hop in the booth and I spit never quit
This beat is Goliath so I guess I'm like David
I wake up every morning just to get faded
I meditate a minute, so my souls fully jaded.
Yet a death bed is where my head shall be cradled.
Cry me a river - my legs will be waded,
Shackles on my wrists all my demons are weighted,
Walking through life feeling so agitated,
The pain of it all can never be aided.
Write all my wrongs on a bible page
Demons come out to play when I slay...
Realising depression is all in my brain
but thinking of something else I can say
Like when does it all go awayyya

Gah damn,

Fuck on yo bitch,
Keep that mouth stitched
We can have it your way,
I’ll be on the highway
You ain’t really bout this,
Keep that hand on your face,

Butchu you know, I ain’t gotta let it go,
I got nothing to lose, watch em duck like a goose

Got a glance, of the man, damn
I can’t fuck with any gimmicks,
I can’t fuck with any gimmicks,
I can’t fuck with any gymnasts,
I can’t fuck with any gimmicks
I be making all these sounds,
Then my mood gets to flippin
Another dawg up in the pound,
Barking at your treason,
Never for no reason,
I be floating in the deep end
Problems that I’m sweeping
That’s right, Yung blood, I can do my math,
And even if you add it up right, you ain’t gonna pass
Hit the dash, keep that trash, in the trash
Structure trash, music trash, fuck this trash,
Fighting off devil, tryna get my sound right
Paying off a mixer, tryna get your sound right
On a different level, yours don’t even sound right
Verses, I got several, versus who, a clout dyke
Showing what you’d do, for some god damn clout, sike
Laughing to the bank, Snappin till it breaks,
I don’t run my mouth on tracks,
Don’t be running like a train,
Every sound the same,
I got too much on my plate,
And a bitch made mufucka, just the dessert
Find me anytime, open a hole in your shirt
Put this pussy in skirts,
Don’t make me pass on my curse,
If we some nobodies, why you saltier than fritos,
Half ass, lay up, eyes closed, make a free throw,
That track, throw up, bitch blow my pito
I might tag a couple rappers, just to see if that's the cheat code

(Verse starts at 35 secs)
I remember way back now the past Is enact
Back when I was In middle school now class Is Intact
I was brutally bullied attacked and harassed
By the vast In the class came out sad In advance
I started martial arts training In my freshmen year
To conquer my fears but never to Impress my peers
My motives were sincere to further stress my sphere
Express myself with the art and to progress my veer
(Chorus)
Wake me up Inside
Wake me up Inside
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
(2nd verse)
As time went on, I became more competent
My strength sky rocketed, I became more confident
I didn't just stop with this, my frames more prominent
Spider powers topped with this, Integrates form complements
Yet, I never changed I still remained the same
I just became unafraid to go face the gangs
The haters and bullies with those dense chains
Who the hell are you? Who am I, I'm Web Fang
(Chorus)
Wake me up Inside
Wake me up Inside
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
(3rd verse)
I hate rich kids their spoiled and need the right vision
If I become Impatient then my might thickens
If your spitting out some facts then I might listen
If lies thicken I might risen with blaze and tight fisten
Senses heighten and driven so you know I'm super human
Non booster using unlike you abuser humans
Abusing substances submitting till something hits
Then punk and bitch In a fucking ditch when It gets rough and shit
I'm over pressuring the scale now measuring
Has a limiting of 9000 power leveling
medal with my writing and I'll break you like a pencil
I'm ungentle, My frame Is harder than metal
Settle, before you get fucking cracked In the temple
Act mental, get hit by some flying bricks and tremble
And when you tremble the pain will be dreadful
I'll cut of all your blood vessels, oh how stressful
Relentless giving on a endless mission
Tremendous ambition this stupendous transition
Breaking free of all this lying deceptive spitting
Breaking through their defenses with the effective mixing
Of truth honor this Is the time to take a stand
Only hardships and experience can make a man
All of the feelings I feel It's so real In me
With great power must also come great responsibility
(Chorus)
Wake me up Inside
Wake me up Inside
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone

LilProdigy we up in the hills

call me flexing oh well but we got racks
we got stacks

(Verse1)

keep pouring lean in my cup
tell her bring some friends
we pull up in a benz
yea we go in so boss like its level 10
rappers be talking bout trap they don’t really mean it cause it's all for fame
Look at me look into my eyes I been through some pain
we get racks got a private plane
to much on my mind im focused on some other things
When you a boss in the game you show hella patience
Bitches going on your page, don't know where the bank is
She keep blowing up my phone, said she wanna play
Spent one night at my crib, say she wanna stay
(Hook)(3x)
LilProdigy we up in the hills
we aint bout that dont pop no pills

eating yo girl like some meals
yea she on her knees now kneels
call me flexing oh well but we got racks
we got stacks

we dont slack
we get rack
ate her like a big mac
(Verse2)
Fucked the hoe with magic, call it hocus pocus
Los the dopest spoken, flow and stroke the coldest
Stroked the hoe and told her, "Woah, woah, woah catch it all
Like Pokemon then poke the poke to free 'em
Hokey Pokey, put your left foot in
I put the effort in, no don’t eff with them
The Gucci sweats, the retro sneaks
The groove too fresh, the proven best
The cool respect the cool
So who are you, the spectical
The new special dude, the next to rule
The extra ruse, I'm extra rude
My ex could prove that I had to make an extra move now
(Hook)(3x)
LilProdigy we up in the hills

ate her like a big mac
No friends sent to me I have more enemies
Than the many legs of a on the floor centipede
(I hate those things) shit now I'm talking to myself
Well there's no 1 else here I'm awkward If that helps
Call me mentally Impaired I don't really care
A unique mind and way of thinking I can't really spare
I'm just really aware of everything around me
I fear all the hazardous things that surrounds me
I'm just so scared until I'm dared to take a risk
Like a daredevil I don't care If I break a wrist
Now I'm the boldest bravest boasting bravado
I'm Johnny Bravo all buff, Piscasso, Who's Apollo?
Who's a follow? nobody here sticks to a motto
That's all folks, I'll bring another clear view to few tomorrow
But now I gotta end the verse with stem measures
Then wish myself good luck with my future endeavors
one, two, three, four, five this girl whines I give her no time
lime lights flashing by I wanna be hough heftier in his prime (X2)
rolling up this check you see
I ball out like cp3
boost this girl's self-esteem
I do it because she'll gleam
im feeling blue don't rep a C
same city as triple B's
I want a girl with double D's
they only want my Balmain jeans
lets make up this policy
im as fresh as mint tea leaves
like a dragon I spit heat
chinchilla fur coat on me
all these girls that I entice
old lifestyle was like vice
I like cheese I am no mice
sunshine like I am on the rise
Give it all to the capital G
I stay private no army
I don't miss im like Rocky
girls bring their posse im the Fonzie
Choo Choo this gon be a train
she so wet she permeates
passanger seat she made a stain
but I was still between her legs
one, more than plain white tees
just count to 5 and you can be like me
Pussy boys all the way
just push them out cause the got none to say
chorus
yea, swear this a dream but I am not lucid im freeze
colder than diamonds s at the end with the 2 V's
swear I am so clean, mr clean got nothing on me
money machine wait for the beep
25 letter cause im never beat
don't take the L's leave those in the mail
this girl really spinning I call her a dreidel
this girl really tripping like we in the fall
its only winter were in the long haul
repping the triangle 3 eyes she like Paul
give me a call, trap off an iPhone
shades inside im an asshole
use to pitch shde was never thrown
imma honest man hit your girl for some dome
straight up I never lie
break her back wheelchair she almost died
I swear this bitch is on fire
i call her igniter
Huh? What? Stop the music
I just need to improve it
Give me some my talent will shine
Disco ball reflect all night
Share fine wine out in the Ukraine

i hold the gun by the barrel point it to my fuckin head,
whisper to myself bitch you done fucking did it,

i dont wanna listen to your gimmicks
stab you in the fucking brain with the crucifix,
ten shots of blood then i lose my shit,
weeping with sheepskin in my kitchen toting a blade bigger than my dick
asking where the fucking bottles of eyeballs from theunforgotten fallen is,
i am huffing paint juggling pain with my claws tearing off my face,
i am a big disgrace
Intro#1 Kid_Rump
I'm alone
leave it alone I'm to prone to getting hurt
yes I'm sad and lonely but I got it understand me
ntro#2 M8rix
So much Pain its a chain
The True Death since the real breath
Letting go falling through white snow
Chorus#1Kid _Rump
it's an understatement to say I'm not happy
u gave it all up to walk the streets
I can watch the world but I should watch myself
my heart beat slows itself
my whole head under water
the clouds go away and it's clear as day that I'm not okay
but I try to do better
Verse #1 Kid_Rump
i pour my heart out and the sky gets grayer
the tears they burn
but why am I crying if I'm already hurt
already wasted everything else
save the tears for your nasty wealth
I have have a heart of gold
but lately I'd rather sell it than be told I'm okay with it
I'd rather me feel the pain than everyone else
my own being gets worse and worse
as I look to you
He never perceived this to be a problem to retrieve,believed he had
achieved good deeds and redeemed all his issues and his self esteem
yet all of the tissues were,used up from every tear squeezed
And,Every tear streams
Down his face the year seemed to be chaotic but,
He claimed to be relieved
Yet afraid to be seen
In between/in need
And his whole life consisting of routines
And he used to always say -
these rituals are my seeds, they
will help me grow but,I need to be me" -"I was never really
free'd " e was deader then the leaves on the plants
Floating off with the breeze
Chorus#2M8rix
Kill me so im free from hate
Celebrate Delusion from human confusion
Goodbye Shy 12 gauge
Caught on a stage trapped rage
Verse#2Marix
People Wager on strangers no favors
Take My curse into a verse
Trigger fingers loose just drank some juice
Who's Fuse is gone so long
Lifelong Hate i shoulda' Prayed
I feel betrayed
Invade my heart all dark
I see the penitentiary early Journey
All Alone Unknown Stone
Goodbye Good lie supply
Satisfy but sigh no reply
Sky Darkened Hardened
Fool Miniscule Died
Victim of the Gun Sudden death
Don't Impress With Stress
Full of mess less process
Game of Chess express
I ain't Leavin' Until death brings my Flesh
Outro#1Marix
Smiling While driving Fighting
The Lightning of death
Dead and gone so wrong all along
Dead at dawn long gone since last month
Eleventh Day last day okay
Outro#2 Kid_Rump
He couldn't go out,if he did it's
guaranteed that he'd
freeze the only time he would
rest was,asleep or in his dreams and
he was stressed and was depressed it seemed by no means his head reveals every little
problem he conceals,dread and screams
work on my raps like im hooked on chronic
From another place outer space supersonic
Eyes always glued to a screen electronic
Watch as the pendelum swing hypnotic
Bitch imma spread like the plague bubonic
Snitch like a bird heard ya sing like a sonnet
falling from the sky bitch im hot like a comet
I grew up in the days of the tamagachi
Risk yo life rolling dice like yahtzee
Swing a torch like a hateful nazi
See the shores these girls call me papi
you can eat my shorts but you can never copy
to each is yours but you can never stop me
you can live to fight or you can kamikaze
Ive seen the sort that only seek the poppy
take me to court cause its skill vs cocky
Each day I get a lot better woah
these days I never say never yo
Butter me up but im hard like toast
utterly fucked when your friends turn ghost
Diarehaa in your pants I know
Never Grim Cause I reap what I sow
VERSE - BLASKO
MIXMASTER - JAYARE
DO OR DIE MOFOS!!
(verse 1)
Nigga you funny as shit
I'm back and ready to make a hit
My flows legit
I'm bouncing from rhyme to rhyme like a rabbit
I spit so rabid
Though I planed it
Not everything ends the way we want but that's fantastic
Gives advantage
expedient damage
walking to my end in my motherfucking sleep
Let's not panic
Soon ill be know from the Pacific to the Atlantic
Or around the planet
I did this in my own
God didn't plan this
I fucked your sis
Guess that the way life goes so ill walk with it if the shoe fits
As tight as it gets
Fixing your girl with my tool when she's on the fritz
(Bridge)
Ok that was some random shit. Now ima go hard g
Like Donkey Kong B
On my mom Steve (What the fuck)
(1:14)
Where you at x8
(Verse 2) (1:31)
You wanna battle yous crazy
Shut up saying you made me
Yall nigga's lazy
That why I scored stacy
That night was hazy
They've all been lately
That's why I haven't wrote maybe
OR why my album hasn't dropped because its in safety
Behind my navy
The fuckers to kill you on sight daily
I taste your blood
Its kinda tasty
Sweet like a pastry
No wonder your Bitch made
Your made of sugar Novocain
This fight's in your brain
We're both insane
I swear ill kill you
I put that on my grave
On my life
On my mother
On your wife
Like Sriracha I put it on everything
While I write this I see you perishing
While I'm Cherishing
Every moment
While I'm sitting
My people's eating
while this battle is heating
Like my slave day's Your getting a beating
And beatings what I do
If you mess with me the Kxng's men are coming after you.
Mr.Politician I got a personal vendetta
You promised and you promised you'd be making things better
But now you won the game , and things are still the same
so I suggest that you sweat me like I was a sweater
some might say "leave it alone" or "not to rock the boat
but I resist to just dismiss the way you robbed my vote
you promised at election time, but now that you have won
you've turned your back and that is wack so politician run
you told us we should stay in school for future life enjoyment
but please.. people got degrees and still can't find employment
now these slimy suckers got the gall, they got the gumption
to say that we're the problem, now that's the wrong assumption
and we are fed up with the situation that has been brought before us
you can intimidate and discriminate but you can not ignore us
my sources say the war is where you need a fortress to take courses
sons are getting guns and making corpses, so you should listen to this chorus
Another beat. Tell me what yall think.
